* PREREQUISITES

> You must have CImg libraries <http://cimg.sourceforge.net/> installed on your
  system in order to compile and use Jastegal. These libraries are used for a
  high-level wrapping of image managing.

> You also must have zlib installed on your system. zlib is installed almost
  anywhere, and it's use by Jastemal for compression/uncompression operations.


* INSTALLATION

> To install Jastegal on your system you need, of course, g++ and gmake already
  installed. Then, just type:

  $ make
  % make install
